# Machine Learning 101
 A repository to explore basic principles related to machine learning.

## Overview
Machine Learning 101 aims to discuss and demonstrate different topics related to machine learning. Covered topics will include how to preprocess data for machine learning models, regression and classification models, and unsupervised learning using clustering algorithms. These lessons will cover the basics of how to run different algorithms, and are intended for those who are new to machine learning and are curious to learn from the very beginning. Welcome to Machine Learning 101!

## Included Notebooks
In this repository, there are several notebooks, each one containing detailed discussion of one machine learning topic. The topics include:
- How to preprocess data for machine learning.
- How to build and interpret regression models.
- How to build and interpret classification models.

## Other materials
Also included are a few written lesson materials that were not included in the notebooks. These can be found in the PDF Lessons folder and include topics like:
- Supervised vs. unsupervised machine learning
